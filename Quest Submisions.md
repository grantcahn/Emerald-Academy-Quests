Emerald Academy Quests for Flow / Cadence development

**Chapter 1 - Day 1**

**What is a Blockchain ?**
It is a chain of nodes that connect to each other in a decentralized way. The nodes are called blocks and can store information in it, most of the time transactions. The blockchain doesn't belong to anyone and is viewable by anyone.

**What is a Smart Contract ?**
It is a "contract" that lives on the blockchain. It is used to communicate with the nodes and stores resources, transactions, scripts and more on the blocks. They are also used to immediately automate the execution of an agreement, so that all participants can be certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement. 

**Difference between a Script and a Transaction?**

A script "looks" and reads information from the blockchain and is free, whereas a transaction costs GAS and actually changes the "state" within a smart contract on the blockchain.


**Chapter 1 - Day 2**
 
**What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
1. Safety and Security
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

**In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**
1- Because the smart contracts will normally contain valuable items, safety and security is CRUCIAL.
2- Learning a new language is so much easier when it is easy to understand.
3- It helps a lot when you feel familiar with so many concepts of Cadence that it almost feels like you already know it.
4- Debugging can be a nightmare if the errors are not clear and can put someone off of learning Cadence.
